  - Remove map fog
  - Discover all locations

I don't plan to implement any sort of item editing.

## Usage
1. Open the online editor linked above or clone the repo and open `index.html` in any web browser.
2. Select a `.sav` file (or `.yaml`) if you have one.
3. Enter your Steam or Epic ID - whichever one you license the game through.
   - These can be found on each platform's account setting website, or in the save file path for Steam.
   - Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/account/ (17 characters)
   - Epic: https://www.epicgames.com/account/personal/ (32 characters)
4. Click **Import** - This will decrypt the save and place the YAML text in the integrated editor.
5. **Export your original save as a backup.** Keep these timestamped files in case something goes wrong.
6. Edit your save as desired - refer to [docs](docs/README.md) for basic info about the structure
   - Apply presets to automatically make common changes that are relatively safe & reliable. These are applied in the editor immediately when clicked. No undo button for now.
7. Download as `.sav`
8. Rename or delete your original save and replace it with the new one, removing the timestamp.
   - Recommended to keep a copy of the new save with the timestamp as a backup (in addition to the pre-edit backup).

**Notes:**
- Consider disabling cloud backups for the game to prevent save files from being reverted in some situations.
- You can safely replace saves while the game is running as long as a different character is selected.
- Modifying a save for a loaded character wont work as the save is in memory at that point and will overwrite the file on disk.
- Don't attempt to modify `profile.sav` while the game is running for the above reason.

## Preset Details
These run JavaScript functions which apply pre-configured edits to save files quickly and consistently.

- You can apply as many presets as you want.
- They update the YAML text you see in the editor.
- They're intended to be modular, so you may need to run a few to get the desired effect.
  - Example: "Unlock all collectibles" will technically just "collect" them. You'd also need to apply "Discover all locations" to have them shown on your map.

- **Unlock UVHM** (Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, i.e. post-game)
  - Sets values in the save to unlock UVH rank 1-5. You can switch between them in-game.
  - Doesn't complete any missions, so you could theoretically play the story from level 1 in UVHM difficulty which isn't otherwise possible.
  - Loading a save with this & story completion will enable starting at level 30 (flag is automatically added to `profile.sav`).
  - Completes all UVH challenges.

### Misc

## Where Are My Saves?
**Windows:**
- Navigate to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Borderlands 4\Saved\SaveGames\`
  - Steam version will have a sub-folder with a 17-digit name - this is your steam ID which you'll need to encrypt/decrypt save files.
  - Navigate deeper like `.\<steam_id>\Profiles\client\`
- `1.sav`, `2.sav`, etc. files represent characters (import these with the editor)
- `profile.sav` contains global state such as black market inventory and bank contents. (the editor also works with this file)
